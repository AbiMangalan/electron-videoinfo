# IPC Handlers Directory

This directory contains Inter-Process Communication (IPC) handlers that manage communication between the main and renderer processes.

Purpose:
- Organize handling of IPC messages in a structured way
- Implement security checks for IPC calls
- Define clear API boundaries between processes

Each handler file should follow the pattern:
1. Register event listeners
2. Validate incoming data
3. Perform main process operations
4. Return results to renderer processes
