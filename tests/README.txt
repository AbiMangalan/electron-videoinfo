# Tests Directory

This directory contains test files for the application.

Suggested organization:
- unit/: Tests for individual functions and components
- integration/: Tests for interactions between components
- e2e/: End-to-end tests that simulate user behavior

Testing best practices:
- Each test file should correspond to a source file
- Tests should be independent and idempotent
- Use mocks for external dependencies
